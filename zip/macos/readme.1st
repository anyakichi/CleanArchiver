This port is for Mac versions before Mac OS X.  As Mac OS X is build on Unix,
use the Unix port for Mac OS X. - 7 June 2008


Before you start:

Extract "*.hqx" and "source:*.hqx" first and read the Readme.txt.

The resource file and the compiler project files are in BinHex form because
they contain Macintosh resource forks and as such can not be simply
stored a normal file on a non-Macintosh system.  BinHex form is the
traditional way for transferring such files via non-Macintosh systems.
It's also the safest since it uses only printable characters.  The ".hqx"
files must be converted with StuffitExpander or BinHex 4.0 (or equivalent)
on a Macintosh system before using them.

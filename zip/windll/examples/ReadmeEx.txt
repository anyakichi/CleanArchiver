WinDLL Examples Readme

This directory has projects for example programs showing how to use
the Win32 versions of the Zip LIB and DLL.  The C examples generally
use example.h and example.c in this directory, while other projects
such as for Visual Basic and C# have their own code.

These are more or less minimum examples showing the basics.  They
probably need some work before use in any real situation.

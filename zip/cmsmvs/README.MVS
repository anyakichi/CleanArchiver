Thank you for trying this first port of ZIP for VM/CMS and MVS!


                        Using under MVS:
                    ---------------------------

1. To use the Info-ZIP's ZIP under MVS you need:

   - C/370 ver 2.1 compiler or another compatible compiler supporting
     long names for function/variable names.

2. To compile the program under MVS do :

   - unzip all the files from zip22.zip file. They are stored as
     ASCII format so you have to unzip them first on PC or other
     system that already have UNZIP, and then upload them to the
     mainframe with ASCII to EBCDIC conversion.

   - Copy all the .C files in the PDS called youruserid.ZIP.C

   - Copy all the .H files in the PDS called youruserid.ZIP.H

   - adjust the job ZIPMVSC.JOB to work on your size. Change my
     userid - C888090 to yours

   - execute the job ZIPMVSC to compile and link all the sources.

   - maybe you have to preallocate PDS datasets named:
     youruserid.ZIP.OBJ and youruserid.ZIP.LOAD

   - execute ZIPVMC to compile and link all the sources.

   - if everything is ok you will get an ZIP MODULE

   - the warnings about the duplicated ASCII and EBCDIC symbols
     are OK :-)

3. Using ZIP

   - Just read MANUAL

   - A few exceptions concerning MVS

     3.1. if you want to make a portable zip file that is to be unzipped
          on ASCII based systems use the -a option

     3.2. If you want to zip the input files as binary ebcdic files
          use the -B (capital letter) option

     3.3. The date/end the time of the input files is set in the zip's
          dir to the current system date/time

     3.4. Without specifying the "-a" or "-B" option, the ZIP program
          defaults to "native" (EBCDIC) mode and tries to preserve the
          file information (LRECL,BLKSIZE..)
          So when you UNZIP a file zipped with ZIP under VM/MVS it
          restores the file info.

          There currently some problems with file with RECFM=V*
          I don't save the length of each record yet :-)

     3.5. No wildcards are supported as input file names:

          So you CAN'T use things like: zip myzip *.c

     3.6. You can use DD names for zipfilename for example:

          under tso/rexx:

           "alloc fi(input) da('myzip.zip')"
           "zip dd:input file1.txt file2.txt ..."

          under Batch:

           //MYZIP    JOB  (account)
           //STEP1    EXEC PGM=ZIP,PARM='dd:input file1.txt file2.txt'
           //STEPLIB  DD DSN=userid.UNZIP.LOAD,DISP=SHR
           //INPUT    DD DSN=userid.MYZIP.ZIP,DISP=NEW,
           //            SPACE=(15000,(15000,10000),RLSE),
           //            DCB=(LRECL=80,RECFM=F)
           //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*

That's all for now.

Have fun!

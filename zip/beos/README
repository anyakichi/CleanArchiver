Info-ZIP's zip for BeOS

KNOWN BUGS

- None! (as of zip 2.21)

- building on x86 BeOS generates a hell of a lot of bugs; I'm not going to
  worry about them until Be fixes their headers though...

FEATURES

- stores BeOS file attributes, compressing them if possible (as of 2.21,
  this works properly for symbolic links, too; as of 2.3, this works
  properly for symbolic links whether you're storing them as links or not)

- zip files are created with the correct file type (application/zip)

- supports both Metrowerks CodeWarrior (PowerPC platform) and GNU C
  (x86 platform), automatically picking the default compiler for each
  architecture

Please report any bugs to the Zip-Bugs mailing list; our email address is
zip-bugs@lists.wku.edu.  If it's something BeOS-specific, you could email
me directly.

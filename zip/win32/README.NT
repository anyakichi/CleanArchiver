If you're running NT Server (I am not sure about NT Workstation) then you
should do the following to prevent zip/unzip from page swapping itself to
death. And as an added bonus, the zip was about 6% faster.

- open the network control panel

- Click on the services tab

- double-click on the server item to open its properties

- Click the "maximize throughput for network applications" radio button

- save and reboot

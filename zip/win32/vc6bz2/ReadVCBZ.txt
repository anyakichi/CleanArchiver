VC6bz2 Readme

This directory has a VC6 project list that can be used to compile Zip
and the utilities.  The Zip project includes support for the bzip2
compression method.

To include bzip2 support, get a copy of the bzip2 source (bzip2-1.0.4
or later from http://www.bzip.org/ for instance), expand the bzip2
source into a directory, then copy the contents of the bzip2-1.0.4
directory, for instance, into the zip bzip2 directory.  Use this
project to compile zip and bzip2 support should be included.  See
bzip2/install.txt for additional information.

The vc6 directory is similar to this directory but does not include
bzip2 support.  Use that if you do not have a copy of bzip2 or do not
need bzip2 support.

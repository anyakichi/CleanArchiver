Info-ZIP's zip for AtheOS/Syllable

FEATURES
  stores AtheOS/Syllable file attributes, compressing them if possible

TODO
----
There is only one thing to be fixed:
  write_attr() should return count of writed bytes. However that's bug related with AFS only.

Please report any bugs to Info-ZIP at www.info-zip.org.
If this bug related with AtheOS/Syllable only, you can mail me directly: nruslan@hotbox.ru.

Visit the Info-ZIP web site (http://www.info-zip.org) for all the
latest zip and unzip information, FAQs, source code and ready-to-run
executables.

- zip sometimes crashes on some versions of NetBSD (0.8, 0.9 and early
  0.9-current), FreeBSD (<= 1.1) and BSDI (< 1.1) . This is due to a
  bug in stdio.
  Upgrading the stdio package in /usr/src/lib/libc/stdio should
  fix the problem. See *BSD mirrors in src/lib/libc/stdio
  You must at least replace setvbuf.o in all the libc's with a newer version.
